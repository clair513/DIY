# DIY Projects
This repository contains few randomly undertaken projects in **Data Analytics** and **Machine Learning** domain. Intent is to explore few under-valued pre-created Python package/libraries as well as methodologies that can actually create a business impact. Mostly projects vary in content depth and if relevant for reference, each project is also associated with a descriptive run-through article on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@neuralnets) blog. Down the lane, also urge to showcase this repo to **Data Science** aspirants for helping them envision what they can undertake as projects to display their skills.

# Index:
* **WiFi spots Map of Networks** around us with [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) and Python. Selected geographical co-ordinates were of *[Pune (India)](https://www.pmc.gov.in/en/geographic-information-systems)*. Static visual demonstrated using [Geoplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/geoplotlib/) and interactivity enhancement using [Folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/). Static Output as well as [Interactive inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ACNtf6oS0) available for reference, along with a [step-by-step guide on my blog](https://medium.com/@neuralnets/building-a-wifi-spots-map-of-networks-around-you-with-wigle-and-python-5adf72a48140) for learners.

* **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to parse files** containing complex table structured invoice screenshots for text recognition & extraction by applying Deep Learning, using [pytesseract v0.2.6](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/), [Pillow v5.4.1](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) and [OpenCV-4](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/). We feed forward images to our [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) [(RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) network for text recognition. For testing purpose, we experiment on Walmart receipts as well as transaction tables.

* **Exploratory Frequency Analysis on NLP Data** of [IMDB movie reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/utathya/imdb-review-dataset) to gain an insight on buzz words amidst viewer comments. Acts as a pillar for further algorithmic processing! Natural language processing has been carried out using [NLTK v3.4](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/) and visual representation for word tagging is implemented using [Word Cloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/).
 
* **Coloring Black & White Images** by applying [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). Selected architecture refers to Zhang et al.â€™s ECCV paper, [Colorful Image Colorization](http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/) where he trains [Imagenet](http://image-net.org/) dataset to [Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) from RGV with mean annealing. Implementation is done using [OpenCV-4](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), by utilizing pre-trained `.caffemodel` which contains *weights* for actual layers & `.prototxt` file which shall define our *model architecture*.

* **Manipulation of PDF Files** using core Python for varied use cases. Involves splitting a multi-page PDF file into individual page files, merging individual files into a single PDF file, slicing out selective pages from a multi-page PDF file based on index page numbers, and rotating all pages of a PDF file in either clockwise or anti-clockwise direction as per use. Involves usage of built-in `os` and `glob` packages, along with [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) package.

* **Face Detection in static Images** by applying `face detector` capability of *OpenCV-4* `dnn` module, using pre-trained *Caffe Deep Learning* model based on the **Single Shot Detector (SSD)** framework with a [ResNet network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResNet). Architecture includes `.prototxt` files from `samples/dnn/face_detector/` directory of [OpenCV-4](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) GitHub repository & associated Weights for actual layers.
