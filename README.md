# DIY Projects
This repository contains few randomly undertaken projects in **Data Analytics** and **Machine Learning** domain. Intent is to explore few under-valued pre-created Python package/libraries as well as methodologies that can actually create a business impact. Mostly projects vary in content depth and if relevant for reference, each project is also associated with a descriptive run-through article on my Medium blog. Down the lane, also urge to showcase this repo to *Data Science* aspirants for helping them envision what they can undertake as projects to display their skills.

# Index:
* **WiFi spots Map of Networks** around us with [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) and Python. Selected geographical co-ordinates were of *[Pune (India)](https://www.pmc.gov.in/en/geographic-information-systems)*. Static visual demonstrated using [Geoplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/geoplotlib/) and interactivity enhancement using [Folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/). Static Output as well as [Interactive inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ACNtf6oS0) available for reference, along with a [step-by-step guide on my blog](https://medium.com/@neuralnets/building-a-wifi-spots-map-of-networks-around-you-with-wigle-and-python-5adf72a48140) for learners.

* **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to parse PDF files** containing complex table structured invoice screenshots for text recognition & extraction by applying Deep Learning, using [pytesseract v0.2.6](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/), [Pillow v5.4.1](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) and [OpenCV-4](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/). We convert input PDF to image and feed forward to our [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) [(RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) network for text recognition. For testing purpose, we experiment on documents from [United States FY-2019 President's Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/budget-fy2019.pdf).
 
* **Coloring Black & White Images** by applying [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). Selected architecture refers to Zhang et al.â€™s ECCV paper, [Colorful Image Colorization](http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/) where he trains [Imagenet](http://image-net.org/) dataset to [Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) from RGV with mean annealing. Implementation is done using [OpenCV-4](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) as well as with [Keras v2.2.4](https://pypi.org/project/Keras/)(on [TensorFlow](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/)) separately, by transfer learning using pre-trained feature model.
